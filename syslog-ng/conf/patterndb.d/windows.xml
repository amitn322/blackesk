This event is generated when a logon session is created. It is generated on the computer that was accessed.

The subject fields indicate the account on the local system which requested the logon. This is most commonly a service such as the Server service, or a local process such as Winlogon.exe or Services.exe.

The logon type field indicates the kind of logon that occurred. The most common types are 2 (interactive) and 3 (network).

The New Logon fields indicate the account for whom the new logon was created, i.e. the account that was logged on.

The network fields indicate where a remote logon request originated. Workstation name is not always available and may be left blank in some cases.

The authentication information fields provide detailed information about this specific logon request.
 - Logon GUID is a unique identifier that can be used to correlate this event with a KDC event.
 - Transited services indicate which intermediate services have participated in this logon request.
 - Package name indicates which sub-protocol was used among the NTLM protocols.
 - Key length indicates the length of the generated session key. This will be 0 if no session key was requested. (EventID 4624)</test_message>

            <test_message program="win2k8">sdf: Application SceCli: [Warning] Security policies were propagated with warning. 0x534 : No mapping between account names and security IDs was done.

Advanced help for this problem is available on http://support.microsoft.com. Query for "troubleshooting 1202 events". 

Error 0x534 occurs when a user account in one or more Group Policy objects (GPOs) could not be resolved to a SID.  This error is possibly caused by a mistyped or deleted user account referenced in either the User Rights or Restricted Groups branch of a GPO.  To resolve this event, contact an administrator in the domain to perform the following actions: 

1. Identify accounts that could not be resolved to a SID:

From the command prompt, type: FIND /I "Cannot find"  %SYSTEMROOT%\Security\Logs\winlogon.log

The string following "Cannot find" in the FIND output identifies the problem account names.

Example: Cannot find JohnDough.

In this case, the SID for username "JohnDough" could not be determined. This most likely occurs because the account was deleted, renamed, or is spelled differently (e.g. "JohnDoe"). 

2. Use RSoP to identify the specific User Rights, Restricted Groups, and Source GPOs that contain the problem accounts:

a. Start -&gt; Run -&gt; RSoP.msc
b. Review the results for Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment and Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\Restricted Groups for any errors flagged with a red X.
c. For any User Right or Restricted Group marked with a red X, the corresponding GPO that contains the problem policy setting is listed under the column entitled "Source GPO". Note the specific User Rights, Restricted Groups and containing Source GPOs that are generating errors. 

3. Remove unresolved accounts from Group Policy

a. Start -&gt; Run -&gt; MMC.EXE
b. From the File menu select "Add/Remove Snap-in..."
c. From the "Add/Remove Snap-in" dialog box select "Add..."
d. In the "Add Standalone Snap-in" dialog box select "Group Policy" and click "Add"
e. In the "Select Group Policy Object" dialog box click the "Browse" button.
f. On the "Browse for a Group Policy Object" dialog box choose the "All" tab
g. For each source GPO identified in step 2, correct the specific User Rights or Restricted Groups that were flagged with a red X in step 2. These User Rights or Restricted Groups can be corrected by removing or correcting any references to the problem accounts that were identified in step 1. (EventID 1202)</test_message>

Summary information on the number of these binds received within the past 24 hours is below. 
 
You can enable additional logging to log an event each time a client makes such a bind, including information on which client made the bind.  To do so, please raise the setting for the "LDAP Interface Events" event logging category to level 2 or higher. 
 
Number of simple binds performed without SSL/TLS: 0
